Emulgator is a Gameboy emulator still under development.

## Resources
The following are links to resources that proved to be useful when programming an emulator.

* https://gbdev.io/list.html#peripherals -> Collection of many good resources.
* https://gbdev.io/pandocs/About.html -> PanDocs.
* http://marc.rawer.de/Gameboy/Docs/GBCPUman.pdf -> It seems like this source is wrong with the instructions RRCA RLCA RRA RLA. The zero flag is NOT set, but reset.
* https://github.com/AntonioND/giibiiadvance/blob/master/docs/TCAGBD.pdf -> For maximum accuracy.

### Test Roms
This is the best list in a github repo: https://github.com/c-sp/gameboy-test-roms, compiled version is under https://github.com/c-sp/gameboy-test-roms/releases.

### Opcode Lists
* https://izik1.github.io/gbops/ -> Excellent opcode list.
* https://gbdev.io/gb-opcodes/optables/ -> Also good opcode list.
* https://www.pastraiser.com/cpu/gameboy/gameboy_opcodes.html -> Opcode list (Cycles are partially wrong for 0xcb opcodes).
* https://gbdev.io/pandocs/CPU_Instruction_Set.html -> You are already familiar with the opcode table.
